##### I used the Minimax algorithm, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. Minimax is an adversarial search algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. 

##### Run the following commands to a game with your computer.

```
> cd tictactoe_ai

> Python runner.py
```
